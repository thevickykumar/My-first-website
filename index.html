      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>C is a procedural language.</li>
        <li>C is a structured programming language.</li>
        <li>C is a mid-level programming language.</li>

      <h3>Why Learn C Programming?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>C helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information.</li>
        <li>After learning C, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.</li>
        <li>Opportunity to work on open source projects. Some of the largest open-source projects such as Linux kernel, Python interpreter, SQLite database, etc. are written in C programming.</li>
